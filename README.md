I'm a Computer Science major college student who lives in Delhi. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future). It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, and C++.<br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to program.<br>
ðŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.<br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about gel pens.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"<br>
